"Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? she’s a cool girl. being the cool girl means i am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because cool girls are above all hot. hot and understanding. cool girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. go ahead, shit on me, i don’t mind, i’m the cool girl. men actually think this girl exists. maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. for a long time cool girl offended me. i used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and i’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: you are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. i’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: the bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! and the cool girls are even more pathetic: they’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. oh, and if you’re not a cool girl, i beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the cool girl. it may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so cool girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so cool girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. there are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants cool girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (how do you know you’re not cool girl? because he says things like: i like strong women. if he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. because i like strong women is code for i hate strong women.) ― gillian flynn, gone girl"," gillian flynn, gone girl", gone girl

"He awoke each morning with the desire to do right, to be a good and meaningful person, to be, as simple as it sounded and as impossible as it actually was, happy. and during the course of each day his heart would descend from his chest into his stomach. by early afternoon he was overcome by the feeling that nothing was right, or nothing was right for him, and by the desire to be alone. by evening he was fulfilled: alone in the magnitude of his grief, alone in his aimless guilt, alone even in his loneliness. i am not sad, he would repeat to himself over and over, i am not sad . as if he might one day convince himself. or fool himself. or convince others--the only thing worse than being sad is for others to know that you are sad. i am not sad. i am not sad. because his life had unlimited potential for happiness, insofar as it was an empty white room. he would fall asleep with his heart at the foot of his bed, like some domesticated animal that was no part of him at all. and each morning he would wake with it again in the cupboard of his rib cage, having become a little heavier, a little weaker, but still pumping. and by the midafternoon he was again overcome with the desire to be somewhere else, someone else, someone else somewhere else. i am not sad.  ― jonathan safran foer, everything is illuminated"," jonathan safran foer, everything is illuminated", everything is illuminated

"Make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. the very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. the joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. if you want to get more out of life, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. but once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty. ― jon krakauer, into the wild"," jon krakauer, into the wild", into the wild

"You should date a girl who reads. date a girl who reads. date a girl who spends her money on books instead of clothes, who has problems with closet space because she has too many books. date a girl who has a list of books she wants to read, who has had a library card since she was twelve. find a girl who reads. you’ll know that she does because she will always have an unread book in her bag. she’s the one lovingly looking over the shelves in the bookstore, the one who quietly cries out when she has found the book she wants. you see that weird chick sniffing the pages of an old book in a secondhand book shop? that’s the reader. they can never resist smelling the pages, especially when they are yellow and worn. she’s the girl reading while waiting in that coffee shop down the street. if you take a peek at her mug, the non-dairy creamer is floating on top because she’s kind of engrossed already. lost in a world of the author’s making. sit down. she might give you a glare, as most girls who read do not like to be interrupted. ask her if she likes the book. buy her another cup of coffee. let her know what you really think of murakami. see if she got through the first chapter of fellowship. understand that if she says she understood james joyce’s ulysses she’s just saying that to sound intelligent. ask her if she loves alice or she would like to be alice. it’s easy to date a girl who reads. give her books for her birthday, for christmas, for anniversaries. give her the gift of words, in poetry and in song. give her neruda, pound, sexton, cummings. let her know that you understand that words are love. understand that she knows the difference between books and reality but by god, she’s going to try to make her life a little like her favorite book. it will never be your fault if she does. she has to give it a shot somehow. lie to her. if she understands syntax, she will understand your need to lie. behind words are other things: motivation, value, nuance, dialogue. it will not be the end of the world. fail her. because a girl who reads knows that failure always leads up to the climax. because girls who read understand that all things must come to end, but that you can always write a sequel. that you can begin again and again and still be the hero. that life is meant to have a villain or two. why be frightened of everything that you are not? girls who read understand that people, like characters, develop. except in the twilight series. if you find a girl who reads, keep her close. when you find her up at 2 am clutching a book to her chest and weeping, make her a cup of tea and hold her. you may lose her for a couple of hours but she will always come back to you. she’ll talk as if the characters in the book are real, because for a while, they always are. you will propose on a hot air balloon. or during a rock concert. or very casually next time she’s sick. over skype. you will smile so hard you will wonder why your heart hasn’t burst and bled out all over your chest yet. you will write the story of your lives, have kids with strange names and even stranger tastes. she will introduce your children to the cat in the hat and aslan, maybe in the same day. you will walk the winters of your old age together and she will recite keats under her breath while you shake the snow off your boots. date a girl who reads because you deserve it. you deserve a girl who can give you the most colorful life imaginable. if you can only give her monotony, and stale hours and half-baked proposals, then you’re better off alone. if you want the world and the worlds beyond it, date a girl who reads. or better yet, date a girl who writes. ― rosemarie urquico", rosemarie urquico,no book found

"Perhaps the greatest faculty our minds possess is the ability to cope with pain. classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need. first is the door of sleep. sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all its pain. sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. when a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or faint. this is the mind's way of protecting itself from pain by stepping through the first door. second is the door of forgetting. some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. in addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. the saying 'time heals all wounds' is false. time heals most wounds. the rest are hidden behind this door. third is the door of madness. there are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. while this may not seem beneficial, it is. there are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. last is the door of death. the final resort. nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told. ― patrick rothfuss, the name of the wind"," patrick rothfuss, the name of the wind", the name of the wind

"Only once in your life, i truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. you tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. you share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. when something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. they are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. there is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. you can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. the things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. colours seem brighter and more brilliant. laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. a phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. in their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. you think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. you open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. you find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. you find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life. ― bob marley", bob marley,no book found

"The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. we spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. we have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. we have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. we drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch tv too much, and pray too seldom. we have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. we talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. we've learned how to make a living, but not a life. we've added years to life not life to years. we've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. we conquered outer space but not inner space. we've done larger things, but not better things. we've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. we've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. we write more, but learn less. we plan more, but accomplish less. we've learned to rush, but not to wait. we build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. these are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. these are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. these are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. it is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. a time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete... remember, to spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. remember, to say, ""i love you"" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. a kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person might not be there again. give time to love, give time to speak! and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. ― bob moorehead, words aptly spoken"," bob moorehead, words aptly spoken", words aptly spoken

"The best fantasy is written in the language of dreams. it is alive as dreams are alive, more real than real ... for a moment at least ... that long magic moment before we wake. fantasy is silver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold and lapis lazuli. reality is plywood and plastic, done up in mud brown and olive drab. fantasy tastes of habaneros and honey, cinnamon and cloves, rare red meat and wines as sweet as summer. reality is beans and tofu, and ashes at the end. reality is the strip malls of burbank, the smokestacks of cleveland, a parking garage in newark. fantasy is the towers of minas tirith, the ancient stones of gormenghast, the halls of camelot. fantasy flies on the wings of icarus, reality on southwest airlines. why do our dreams become so much smaller when they finally come true? we read fantasy to find the colors again, i think. to taste strong spices and hear the songs the sirens sang. there is something old and true in fantasy that speaks to something deep within us, to the child who dreamt that one day he would hunt the forests of the night, and feast beneath the hollow hills, and find a love to last forever somewhere south of oz and north of shangri-la. they can keep their heaven. when i die, i'd sooner go to middle earth. ― george r.r. martin", george r.r. martin,no book found

"For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. i revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. and even more i revere them when they stand alone. they are like lonely persons. not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like beethoven and nietzsche. in their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. when a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. and every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. trees are sanctuaries. whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. they do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. a tree says: a kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, i am life from eternal life. the attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. i was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. a tree says: my strength is trust. i know nothing about my fathers, i know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. i live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and i care for nothing else. i trust that god is in me. i trust that my labor is holy. out of this trust i live. when we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: be still! be still! look at me! life is not easy, life is not difficult. those are childish thoughts. let god speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. you are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. but every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. home is neither here nor there. home is within you, or home is nowhere at all. a longing to wander tears my heart when i hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. if one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. it is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. it is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. it leads home. every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother. so the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. they are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. but when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. he wants to be nothing except what he is. that is home. that is happiness. ― herman hesse, bäume: betrachtungen und gedichte"," herman hesse, bäume: betrachtungen und gedichte", bäume: betrachtungen und gedichte

"If i should have a daughter…instead of mom, she’s gonna call me point b. because that way, she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me. and i’m going to paint the solar system on the back of her hands so that she has to learn the entire universe before she can say oh, i know that like the back of my hand. she’s gonna learn that this life will hit you, hard, in the face, wait for you to get back up so it can kick you in the stomach. but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. there is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by band-aids or poetry, so the first time she realizes that wonder-woman isn’t coming, i’ll make sure she knows she doesn’t have to wear the cape all by herself. because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers, your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. believe me, i’ve tried. and baby, i’ll tell her don’t keep your nose up in the air like that, i know that trick, you’re just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. or else, find the boy who lit the fire in the first place to see if you can change him. but i know that she will anyway, so instead i’ll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boats nearby, ‘cause there is no heartbreak that chocolate can’t fix. okay, there’s a few heartbreaks chocolate can’t fix. but that’s what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything if you let it. i want her to see the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat, to look through a magnifying glass at the galaxies that exist on the pin point of a human mind. because that’s how my mom taught me. that there’ll be days like this, there’ll be days like this my momma said when you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises. when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you wanna save are the ones standing on your cape. when your boots will fill with rain and you’ll be up to your knees in disappointment and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you, ‘cause there is nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times it’s sent away. you will put the wind in win some lose some, you will put the star in starting over and over, and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life. and yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting i am pretty damn naive but i want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. it can crumble so easily but don’t be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it. baby, i’ll tell her remember your mama is a worrier but your papa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more. remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things and always apologize when you’ve done something wrong but don’t you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining. your voice is small but don’t ever stop singing and when they finally hand you heartbreak, slip hatred and war under your doorstep and hand you hand-outs on street corners of cynicism and defeat, you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother. ― sarah kay", sarah kay,no book found

"Once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. tis some visitor,"" i muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door — only this, and nothing more."" ah, distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december, and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. eagerly i wished the morrow; — vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost lenore — for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore — nameless here for evermore. and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating, tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door — some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; — this it is, and nothing more."" presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, sir,"" said i, ""or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping, and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, that i scarce was sure i heard you""— here i opened wide the door; — darkness there, and nothing more. deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; but the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""lenore?"" this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""lenore!"" — merely this, and nothing more. back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. surely,"" said i, ""surely that is something at my window lattice: let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore — let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; — 'tis the wind and nothing more."" open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door — perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door — perched, and sat, and nothing more. then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore. though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" i said, ""art sure no craven, ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore — tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore!"" quoth the raven, ""nevermore."" much i marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, though its answer little meaning— little relevancy bore; for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door — bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, with such name as ""nevermore. ― edgar allan poe, the raven"," edgar allan poe, the raven", the raven
